                                Today marks the one-year anniversary of the Lizard’s attack on Manhattan and the death of Captain George Stacy, of New York City Police Department’s Major Crimes Unit. Stacy was a decorated police veteran who left behind a loving wife and four children. In this Daily Bugle exclusive we spoke with the Stacy family, Helen, who lost a heroic husband that day, and Gwen, Phillip, Howard, and Simon, who lost their father.

                                Helen Stacy: It’s hard to believe George died a year ago. That night, that call, it still hurts as if it happened five seconds ago.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                DB: Does your family take any solace that Curt Connors will spend the rest of his life in prison?

                                Helen Stacy: I think that would have mattered much more to George, just to know Connors is paying for his crimes. He cared very deeply about the law and about justice.

                                Gwen Stacy: Very proud, I’m sure. (fighting back tears) And nervous for me, and concerned because he wouldn’t want me to be scared. And excited for my future. 
                            </p>

                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Gwen Stacy: I think… (long pause) I think both of them did what they thought needed to be done without regard to the risk. I think both of them were heroes that night. I regret that my dad died, but not at the expense of anyone else.
                            </p>

                                    Not content to just show off his latest sports car, young billionaire and future misanthrope, Harry Osborn was seen arm in arm with supermodel Valencia Vitaly at the closing ceremonies in Sochi. Osborn had reporters scrambling for an interview, but all questions went unanswered as he disappeared soon after the ceremony ended.

                                    Harry’s Russian sojourn is just the latest in a long European adventure that’s included skydiving in Monaco, week long parties in Seville and impromptu street races in the narrow streets of Prague. Suffice it to say, Harry seems intent on spending his trust fund as fast and as dangerously as possible.
                                </p>

                                    Rumor has it people inside Oscorp want Harry to stay as far away as possible, but as the health of his father is still uncertain, the rest of the world wants to know: what will it take to bring him home?

                                        In the wake of her husband Dr. Curt Connors’s horrifying transformation into a lizard creature and subsequent rampage across New York, Martha Connors left the city to begin a new life with her son Billy. As the one year anniversary of the event approaches on Thursday, we caught up with her to talk where she’s been, where she’s going and ultimately what it’s like to have a convicted bioterrorist as an estranged husband.

                                        Martha: (long pause) I think it’s best if I kept my opinions to myself.

                                        DB: Is that because Oscorp was rumored to have paid you a substantial fee in return for your silence?

                                        Martha: Any money I received from Oscorp was all based on Curt’s contract with the company.

                                        Martha: You’d have to ask them.
                                    </p>

                                    </p>

                                        Martha: He’s ten. He’s too young to really comprehend the magnitude of the pain his father has caused, but he is old enough to understand his father has issues and has done some very horrible things.
                                    </p>

                                        Martha: Like everyone else, I watched the attack live on cable news, shocked at what was going on. But the first time the cameras caught it ­–him – the Lizard – in close-up, I knew… I just knew it was Curt. I knew he had finally perfected the cross-genetic formula to regrow limbs… and all it had cost him was his humanity.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Last night, I walked out of the 6-train at 96th Street, only to be greeted by a freshly painted graffiti tag of a large red spider painted on a wooden construction fence.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Generally, I ignore the “modern art” of the masses. I must be far too uncivilized to appreciate the subtle nuances of the work. But in this case, the meaning was not open to interpretation.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Do the young people of this city really want to turn the mysterious creature known as Spider-Man into some kind of modern-day Robin Hood?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                It has been three months since the terrorist attack at Oscorp Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Three months since a man who had changed into a seven-foot tall lizard battled against another man in a red and blue unitard who could crawl up walls. Three months since the city was introduced to a new status quo, one that will adversely affect the entire planet. It has been three months, and we know nothing more about the man called Spider-Man than we did on that terrible night.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                This masked, web-slinging vigilante has refused to identify himself. He has given no public statements. He has refused to be interviewed by the police. He has repeatedly refused requests from the media, including from this paper, to provide some assurance to the people of this city that he means us no harm.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Who appointed him as the new sheriff in town? I didn’t. Did you?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                What gives him the moral, much less legal, authority to decide who deserves punishment and how that punishment should be doled out?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Heroes do not need to promote their actions, but they also do not hide from the people they help. Until Spider-Man tells us more about himself, he is no hero. I dare him to prove me wrong. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
